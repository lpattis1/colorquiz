                                You have a happy disposition and are cheerful and fun to be with.
                                

                                You are creative, often being the one who comes up with new ideas - an ideas person who needs others to bring the ideas into reality - you tend to have your head in the clouds much of the time.
                                
                                With a personality color yellow, you can be very critical of yourself as well as others - you are a perfectionist.
                                
                                You analyze everything, all the time, and are methodical in your thinking.
                                
                                With a yellow personality you are impulsive and make quick decisions, but often, out of anxiety, jump in too quickly and rush things rather than taking things at a steady pace.
                                
                                You have a strong independent streak in you, and are selective with your choice of friends, keeping a small group of close and like-minded friends rather than being involved in team events or large social gatherings.

                                Having red as your favorite color identifies you as extroverted and optimistic, courageous and confident.

                                You are action oriented and physically active - sex is a necessity to you - you have strong survival instincts.

                                With a favorite color red, you like to be the center of attention - in fact all reds crave attention - other people are drawn to the vitality and sense of excitement you emit.

                                As a personality color red, you are stimulating to be with and you radiate a great deal of energy.

                                You are ambitious and competitive and like to be the winner - you are achievement orientated and second place is not good enough for you. With you it is all or nothing.

                                You are conservative, reliable and trustworthy - you are quite trusting of others although you are very wary in the beginning until you are sure of the other person. At the same time, you also have a deep need to be trusted.

                                You are not impulsive or spontaneous - you always think before you speak and act and do everything at your own pace in your own time. You take time to process and share your feelings.

                                You are genuine and sincere, and you take your responsibilities seriously.

                                Having a personality color blue means you have a deep need for peace and harmony in your everyday life - you don't like having your feathers ruffled. You would benefit from daily meditation and quiet time for reflection, introspection and self-discovery.

                                You are a practical, down-to-earth person with a love of nature.

                                You are stable and well balanced or are striving for balance - in seeking this balance, you can at times become unsettled and anxious.

                                Having a personality color green means you are kind, generous and compassionate - good to have around during a crisis as you remain calm and take control of the situation until it is resolved.

                                You are caring and nurturing to others - however you must be careful not to neglect your own needs while giving to others.

                                You are intelligent and love to learn - you are quick to understand new concepts.

                                With a personality color green you have a great need to love and to be loved and you tend to wear your heart on your sleeve- you are an open book who doesn't hide his/her feelings.

                                You are sensitive and compassionate, understanding and supportive, thinking of others before yourself - you are the person others come to for help - being needed motivates you but sometimes people take advantage of you.

                                You are a gentle and free spirit. Your feelings run deep and you can be quite sensitive to hurtful comments from others, although you would never show it.

                                Being a personality color purple, you have a peaceful and tranquil quality and a quiet dignity about you.

                                People are drawn to your charismatic and alluring energy.

                                You are usually introverted rather than extroverted and may give the impression of being shy although this is not the case.

                                You are non-emotional and give the appearance of a dignified and sophisticated person who is in total control - this is often a front as you may feel quite insecure in the company of sophisticated and cultured VIP's and upper class people.

                                You like to keep people at a distance, guarding your emotions and creating an impenetrable barrier between yourself and others.

                                With a personality color black, you may be looking for protection from any negativity that surrounds you.

                                You may wish to create an aura of mystery and intrigue, as in the sexy black negligee.

                                You may be going through a stage of self-denial, not allowing pleasure and joy into your life.

                                You hold things inside and are not good at sharing yourself with others, possibly out of fear.

                                You are methodical in your work, making sure everything is completed as required, down to the last detail.
